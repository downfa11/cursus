# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from Contributor Covenant v2.0 and modified to reflect the scale and operating model of this project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to establish a minimum set of rules that allow technical discussions and contributions to continue without personal attacks, unproductive arguments, or maintainer burnout.

This document:

- Is not a declaration intended to eliminate all conflict, and
- Does not aim to protect all opinions equally.

Rather, its purpose is to clearly block behaviors where attacks on people undermine technical discussion.

## Our Pledge

All participants in this project (users, contributors, reviewers, and maintainers) commit to the following:

- Maintaining an environment where individuals are respected regardless of background, level of experience, or identity
- Allowing criticism of code and design, but not attacks against people
- Framing discussions around solving problems, not “winning” arguments

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected within this project:

- Criticism and discussion based on technical reasoning
- Respect for participants holding different opinions
- Acknowledging mistakes and correcting them
- Creating issues and pull requests with sufficient context
- Acting with consideration for the long-term sustainability of the project

These points may sound obvious, but they are written here because they are often not followed in practice.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are explicitly not tolerated:

- Insults, mockery, personal attacks, or demeaning language
- Sexualized language, hate speech, or threats
- Repeated trolling or deliberate disruption of discussion
- Forcing political or ideological debates into technical issues
- Publishing personal or private information without consent
- Making excessive demands of maintainers or contributors, or acting with an attitude of entitlement

In particular, the assumption that “because this is open source, support should be provided for free” is not respected in this project.

## Communication Guidelines

- Issues and pull requests should be created within the appropriate scope
- Questions should include the minimum information necessary to reproduce the issue
- Do not unnecessarily expand the scope of discussion within a single issue
- Repeated questions, low-effort requests, or pressuring messages may be ignored

Not receiving a response does not grant the right to behave rudely.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers reserve the right to:

- Edit or remove inappropriate issues, pull requests, or comments
- Issue warnings or restrict participation
- Permanently ban participants in cases of repeated or malicious behavior

Maintainers are not neutral arbitrators; they are responsible for the project. While you may disagree with a decision, it is not subject to public debate.

## Reporting

Clear violations of this Code of Conduct may be reported via GitHub Issues. However, not all disputes warrant maintainer intervention.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to interactions within GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions.
