Cursus is a lightweight, partitioned-log message broker written in Go. It runs as a standalone broker or as a Raft-backed cluster and exposes a compact length-prefixed TCP protocol for producers, consumers, administration, and event sourcing.

## Capabilities

- Partitioned topics with key-hash or round-robin routing and per-partition ordering.
- Buffered, batched disk persistence, configurable segment rolling, mmap reads, retention by time or size, and recovered high-watermark checkpoints.
- Durable single-topic and multi-topic consumer groups with generation/lifecycle fencing, broker-owned monotonic `nextOffset` commits, restart resume, and topic-partition isolation.
- Exactly-once broker processing for consume-process-produce transactions: idempotent output, transactional multi-topic offsets in `__consumer_offsets`, durable prepare/final decisions, fenced coordinator-shard failover, timeout abort, recovery, and `read_committed` isolation.
- Raft-backed metadata, partition-leader routing, replication quorum checks, follower catch-up, and leader redirects.
- Event streams with optimistic concurrency, committed-tail reads, durable indexes, and quorum-replicated snapshots.
- TLS, client token authentication and authorization, per-topic ACLs, broker-to-broker mTLS/internal command boundaries, health probes, and Prometheus metrics.
- Go SDK in this repository; Java and Python SDKs are maintained in their own repositories against the same wire contract.

## Contract Boundaries

| Area | Current contract |
|---|---|
| Ordering | Ordered within one partition; no ordering across partitions. |
| Consumer delivery | At-least-once when processing finishes before committing `lastProcessedOffset + 1`. Committing first can produce at-most-once behavior. |
| Transactions | Exactly-once processing within the Cursus broker boundary for one fenced consumer group session across multiple input/output topics. External database or service side effects are outside the broker transaction. |
| Read isolation | `read_committed` is the default and hides open/aborted transactions. `read_uncommitted` exposes the raw committed partition log, including control records. |
| Retention | Time/size deletion and standalone keyed log compaction are supported. Compaction preserves offsets and transaction/control records; distributed and event-sourcing topics reject it. |
| Protocol | Cursus-native TCP framing and commands. This project does not claim byte compatibility with another broker protocol. |

## Quick Start

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cursus-io/cursus:latest
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 -p 9080:9080 -p 9100:9100 ghcr.io/cursus-io/cursus:latest
```

The client protocol listens on `9000`, health probes on `9080`, and Prometheus metrics on `9100` by default. Production deployments should mount durable storage and configure TLS/authentication explicitly.

## Documentation

Start with the [documentation index](docs/README.md), then use the [wire protocol specification](docs/protocol-spec.md), [API reference](docs/reference/api-reference.md), [configuration guide](docs/user-guide/configuration.md), and [SDK overview](docs/sdk-overview.md) as the authoritative contracts.

## Community

Cursus is developed openly. Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, design proposals, and compatibility questions. Contributions should preserve documented protocol behavior and include tests for changed guarantees.
