# Go-broker

## What is Go-broker?

Go-broker is a **lightweight message broker** inspired by Kafka’s design philosophy —
_logically separated but physically distributed data management_.

It aims to provide a minimal, efficient, and extensible messaging backbone for small-scale environments.

<br>

## Why Go-broker?

While Kafka’s persistence and fault-tolerant architecture are powerful,
its operational complexity and infrastructure cost can become heavy burdens for smaller deployments.

Go-broker was created to address these challenges by reimagining Kafka’s core concepts in a simpler form:

- Single-node architecture with minimal dependencies

- Clear logical data isolation and topic partitioning

<br>

In future releases, we will evolve into a distributed cluster
using `etcd` for coordination and metadata management.
