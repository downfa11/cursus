# Cursus Wire Protocol Specification

> Specification revision: 1.1
> Supported wire protocol versions: 1
> Target audience: SDK implementors (C++, Java, Python, Go)

## 1. Transport Layer

### TCP Connection

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Transport | TCP (IPv4/IPv6) |
| Default port | 9000 (configurable) |
| TLS | Optional, TLS 1.2+ required when enabled |
| Health check | HTTP GET `/health` on port 9080 (configurable) |
| Max concurrent connections | 1000 |
| Idle timeout | 5 seconds (server re-reads on timeout, does NOT disconnect) |

### Connection Lifecycle

```
Client              Broker
  |--- TCP connect --->|
  |                    | (worker assigned)
  |--- PROTOCOL_INFO ->| (optional discovery)
  |--- NEGOTIATE ----->| (optional, once per connection)
  |--- command/batch ->| (length-prefixed frame)
  |<-- response -------|
  |--- command ------->|
  |<-- response -------|
  |    ...             |
  |--- EXIT ---------->| (or close socket)
```

A single TCP connection handles all commands sequentially. For parallel operations, open multiple connections.

---

## 2. Framing

Every message (request and response) uses a **4-byte Big Endian length prefix**.

```
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                    Body Length (uint32 BE)                     |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                                                               |
|                     Body (N bytes)                            |
|                                                               |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

- **Max body size**: 64 MB (`67,108,864` bytes)
- **Byte order**: Big Endian (network order) throughout the protocol
- Length field does NOT include itself (only body size)

### Compression

Body may be compressed before framing. Algorithm is configured per-broker (not negotiated per-connection).

| Algorithm | ID |
|-----------|----|
| none | `""` or `"none"` |
| gzip | `"gzip"` |
| snappy | `"snappy"` (xerial format) |
| lz4 | `"lz4"` |

```
Send:  body → compress(body) → [4-byte len][compressed body]
Recv:  [4-byte len][compressed body] → decompress → body
```

---

## 3. Message Types

The broker distinguishes two message types by inspecting the first 2 bytes of the body:

| Magic | Type | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| `0xBA 0x7C` | Binary batch | Structured binary (Section 5) |
| Other | Text command | UTF-8 string (Section 4) |

---

## 4. Text Commands

### Encoding

Text commands use an optional topic+payload envelope:

```
 0                   1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|      Topic Length (uint16 BE) |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        Topic (T bytes)        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     Command Payload (UTF-8)   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Alternatively, raw command strings (without the topic envelope) are accepted if they match a known command keyword.

### Parameter Parsing Rules

- Parameters use `key=value` syntax, separated by whitespace
- **Parameter order is flexible** — the broker parses key=value pairs regardless of order
- The `message=` parameter is special: it captures the entire remainder of the line
- Command names are case-insensitive

### Text Response Contract

Text command responses are machine-readable.

- Success responses MUST be `OK` or `OK key=value ...` unless the command returns a documented JSON envelope with `"status":"OK"`.
- Failure responses MUST be `ERROR: <code> [key=value ...]`.
- Clients SHOULD branch on the `OK` / JSON status / `ERROR:` contract instead of matching natural-language phrases.
- Legacy bare responses, such as the old CREATE phrase or plain integer offsets, are deprecated and should only be accepted by clients as narrow backward-compatible fallbacks.

### Protocol Discovery and Negotiation

Negotiation is optional and connection-scoped. A client that sends neither command remains on wire protocol version 1 with legacy-compatible text errors. Clients should negotiate immediately after opening every TCP connection, before sending application commands.

**PROTOCOL_INFO**

```text
PROTOCOL_INFO
```

Response:

```text
OK protocol=cursus min_version=1 max_version=1 default_version=1 features=<csv> error_classes=<csv>
```

The response is safe to query without changing connection state.

**NEGOTIATE**

```text
NEGOTIATE version=<N> [features=<csv|*>] [require_features=<true|false>]
```

Success response:

```text
OK protocol_version=<N> enabled=<csv> unsupported=<csv>
```

`features=*` enables every feature advertised by `PROTOCOL_INFO`. Named features use lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores, with at most 64 names of 64 bytes each. Unknown valid optional features are returned in `unsupported=`. When `require_features=true`, any unknown feature rejects the negotiation with `ERROR: UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE ...` and leaves the connection context unchanged. An unsupported version returns `ERROR: UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION ...`.

Version 1 features currently advertised by the broker are:

| Feature | Contract |
|---------|----------|
| `structured_errors_v1` | Adds `class=<class> retryable=<bool>` to text `ERROR:` responses on this connection |
| `stream_control_v1` | Supports documented `STREAM_CONTROL` close frames |
| `offset_resume_v1` | Supports broker-owned `FETCH_OFFSET`/commit resume semantics |
| `idempotent_producer_v1` | Supports producer ID, epoch, and sequence fencing |
| `event_sourcing_v1` | Supports event stream and snapshot commands |
| `topic_compaction_v1` | Supports per-topic cleanup policy declaration and standalone keyed closed-segment compaction |
| `consumer_group_subscriptions_v1` | Supports explicit multi-topic and pattern-backed consumer-group registration and topic-partition assignments |
| `transactional_processing_v1` | Supports append-on-send broker transactions, prepare commit/abort, timeout resolution, multi-topic offsets, and exactly-once broker processing |

Feature names describe independent contracts; clients must not infer support for an unadvertised feature from the protocol version alone.

### Command Reference

#### Topic Management

**CREATE**
```
CREATE topic=<name> [partitions=<N>] [idempotent=<true|false>] [event_sourcing=<true|false>] [replication_factor=<N>] [cleanup_policy=<delete|compact|delete,compact>] [retention_hours=<N>] [retention_bytes=<N>] [partitioner=<hash_key|round_robin>] [auth_policy=<open|deny_write|deny_read|acl>] [read_acl=<principal[,principal]>] [write_acl=<principal[,principal]>]
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| partitions | No | 4 | Number of partitions |
| idempotent | No | false | Enable producer dedup |
| event_sourcing | No | false | Enable aggregate stream commands; requires non-compacted history |
| cleanup_policy | No | broker default | `delete`, `compact`, or canonical combined policy `delete,compact` |
| retention_hours | No | 0 | Per-topic retention hours override metadata; 0 means broker default |
| retention_bytes | No | 0 | Per-topic retention bytes override metadata; 0 means broker default |
| partitioner | No | hash_key | `hash_key` uses message key hash, `round_robin` ignores keys |
| auth_policy | No | open | `open`, `deny_write`, `deny_read`, or `acl` topic policy |
| read_acl | No | - | Comma-separated principals allowed to read when `auth_policy=acl`; `*` allows any authenticated principal |
| write_acl | No | - | Comma-separated principals allowed to write when `auth_policy=acl`; `*` allows any authenticated principal |
| replication_factor | No | 3 | Replica count (distributed mode) |

Response: `OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> cleanup_policy=<policy> partitioner=<hash_key|round_robin> auth_policy=<open|deny_write|deny_read|acl> read_acl=<csv> write_acl=<csv> retention_hours=<N> retention_bytes=<N>`

Topic names are a portable on-disk identifier: 1-249 ASCII bytes containing only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=`; `.` and `..` are reserved. Invalid names return `ERROR: invalid_topic_name ...`.

A successful standalone `CREATE` means the versioned topic definition has been atomically replaced and synced in `{log_dir}/__topic_metadata.json` before the new policy or partition count is exposed to publishers. Broker restart restores partition count, idempotent/event-sourcing mode, partitioner, retention, cleanup policy, auth policy, and ACLs from this manifest. Distributed mode commits the same definition through the cluster FSM and includes it in snapshot version 6.

`compact` and `delete,compact` are accepted only by standalone, non-event-sourcing topics. Unsupported combinations return `ERROR: invalid_topic_policy ...` or `ERROR: unsupported_topic_policy ...`. Repeating `CREATE` for an existing event-sourcing topic cannot use a false `event_sourcing` argument to bypass this validation. Repeating `CREATE` also preserves existing partition leader epochs and committed HWMs; only newly added partitions receive new assignments.

**DELETE**
```
DELETE topic=<name>
```
Response: `OK topic=<name> deleted=true`

Standalone deletion first commits removal from the durable manifest, then closes partition workers/handlers and removes topic data. A manifest failure returns `ERROR: delete_topic_failed ...` and leaves the topic registered. After the manifest commit, physical cleanup errors are logged but the response remains successful because the topic is no longer authoritative. Distributed deletion is committed through the FSM.

**LIST**
```
LIST
```
Response: `OK count=<N> topics=<comma-separated-topic-names>`. Empty brokers return `OK count=0 topics=`.

**HELP**
```
HELP
```
Response: `OK commands=<comma-separated-command-names>`.

**DESCRIBE**
```
DESCRIBE topic=<name>
```
Response (JSON):
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "topic": "mytopic",
  "partitions": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "leader": "broker-1:9000",
      "replicas": ["broker-1", "broker-2"],
      "isr": ["broker-1", "broker-2"],
      "leo": 1024,
      "hwm": 1020
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Publishing

**PUBLISH**
```
PUBLISH topic=<name> acks=<0|1|-1|all> producerId=<id> [partition=<N>] [seqNum=<N>] [epoch=<N>] [isIdempotent=<true|false>] message=<text>
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Target topic |
| acks | No | 1 | Durability level |
| producerId | Yes | - | Unique producer ID |
| message | Yes | - | Message payload (captures rest of line) |
| partition | No | round-robin/key policy | Explicit target partition for text PUBLISH. Idempotent producers should use per-partition sequence numbers. |
| seqNum | No | 0 | Sequence number (for idempotent mode) |
| epoch | No | 0 | Producer epoch |
| isIdempotent | No | false | Enable dedup for this message |

Because `message=` captures the rest of the line, optional parameters such as `partition`, `seqNum`, `epoch`, and `isIdempotent` must appear before `message=` in text commands.

Transaction metadata fields such as `transactional_id`, `transaction_state`, and `transaction_marker` are broker-internal on `PUBLISH`. Clients must use `INIT_PRODUCER_ID`, `BEGIN_TXN`, `TXN_PUBLISH`, and `END_TXN`; direct metadata injection is rejected with `ERROR: transaction_metadata_forbidden command=PUBLISH`.

Response (JSON — `AckResponse`):
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "last_offset": 42,
  "producer_id": "producer-1",
  "producer_epoch": 0,
  "seq_start": 1,
  "seq_end": 1,
  "leader": "broker-1:9000"
}
```

**Acks Semantics**:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | Fire-and-forget. Broker returns `OK` immediately |
| `1` | Leader writes to local disk, then responds |
| `-1` / `all` | Leader waits for `min_in_sync_replicas` acknowledgments |

#### Cluster Discovery

**FIND_COORDINATOR**
```
FIND_COORDINATOR group=<name>
```
| Param | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| group | Yes | Consumer group name |

Response: `OK coordinator_id=<broker_id> host=<host> port=<port>`

Any broker can answer this command. The coordinator is determined by consistent hashing of the group name across active brokers.

> In cluster mode, group commands (`JOIN_GROUP`, `SYNC_GROUP`, `LEAVE_GROUP`, `HEARTBEAT`, `COMMIT_OFFSET`, `FETCH_OFFSET`) must be sent to the coordinator. If sent to a non-coordinator broker, the response will be:
> `ERROR: NOT_COORDINATOR host=<coordinator_host> port=<coordinator_port>`

**METADATA**
```
METADATA topic=<name>
```
| Param | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | Topic name |

Response: `OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> leaders=<host:port>,<host:port>,... epochs=<csv> cleanup_policy=<policy> partitioner=<policy> auth_policy=<policy> read_acl=<csv> write_acl=<csv> retention_hours=<N> retention_bytes=<N>`

Returns partition leaders/epochs and the authoritative durable topic policy restored from the standalone manifest or cluster FSM. Leader addresses are in partition order (P0, P1, P2, ...).

Any broker can answer this command. Addresses are the advertised client addresses from the FSM broker registry.

> In cluster mode, `CONSUME` and `STREAM` should be sent to the partition leader. If sent to a non-leader broker, the response will be:
> `ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>`

**CLUSTER_STATUS**
```
CLUSTER_STATUS
```
Response: `OK cluster=<json>`. The JSON payload reports active and inactive brokers, the Raft leader, per-partition leader/epoch/HWM/replica/ISR state, and aggregate leaderless and under-replicated counts. Serialization failure returns `ERROR: marshal_cluster_status_failed reason="..."`.

**ELECT_LEADER**
```
ELECT_LEADER topic=<name> partition=<N> broker=<broker-id>
```
Response: `OK topic=<name> partition=<N> previous_leader=<broker-id> leader=<broker-id> leader_epoch=<N> changed=<true|false>`.

The target must be an active broker in both the replica set and ISR. The Raft FSM compares the expected current leader epoch before changing leaders, increments the epoch exactly once, and preserves the committed HWM and replica membership. A retry against the already selected leader is idempotent. `ELECT_LEADER` is not a partition reassignment or broker-drain command and never promotes an out-of-sync replica.

Missing targets return `ERROR: missing_broker command=ELECT_LEADER`; rejected state changes return `ERROR: leader_election_rejected ...`; an unavailable apply result returns `ERROR: leader_election_result_unavailable ...` and may be retried because election is idempotent.

#### Consumer Group Coordination

**REGISTER_GROUP**

```text
REGISTER_GROUP group=<name> topic=<topic>
REGISTER_GROUP group=<name> topics=<topic-1>,<topic-2>[,...]
REGISTER_GROUP group=<name> pattern=<glob>
```

Exactly one selector is required. `topics` and `pattern` require `consumer_group_subscriptions_v1`; the broker durably stores the selector and its concrete topic-partition expansion. A group member receives each subscribed topic-partition at most once per generation.

**JOIN_GROUP**
```
JOIN_GROUP [topic=<name>] group=<name> member=<id>
```
Response: `OK generation=<N> member=<actual-id> assignments=[0,1,2]`

For a negotiated multi-topic group, omit `topic`; the response uses `topic_assignments=<topic>:P<partition>,...`.

> Broker appends a random 4-digit suffix to the member ID.
> e.g., `member=consumer-1` → actual ID `consumer-1-8374`

**SYNC_GROUP**
```
SYNC_GROUP [topic=<name>] group=<name> member=<actual-id> generation=<N>
```
Response: `OK assignments=[0,1,2]`

**LEAVE_GROUP**
```
LEAVE_GROUP topic=<name> group=<name> member=<actual-id>
```
Response: `OK group=<name> member=<actual-id> left=true`

**HEARTBEAT**
```
HEARTBEAT topic=<name> group=<name> member=<actual-id> [generation=<N>]
```
Response: `OK member=<actual-id> generation=<N>`

| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| group | Yes | - | Consumer group name |
| member | Yes | - | Consumer member ID (with suffix) |
| generation | No | - | Current generation number; if supplied, stale generations return ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH ... |

Recommended interval: 3 seconds. Server session timeout: configurable (default ~30s).

**GROUP_STATUS**
```
GROUP_STATUS group=<name>
```
Response (JSON):
```json
{
  "group_name": "mygroup",
  "topic_name": "mytopic",
  "state": "Stable",
  "generation": 3,
  "member_count": 2,
  "partition_count": 4,
  "members": [
    {
      "member_id": "consumer-1-8374",
      "last_heartbeat": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "assignments": [0, 1]
    }
  ],
  "last_rebalance": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Consuming

**CONSUME** (single poll)
```
CONSUME topic=<name> partition=<N> offset=<N> member=<id> group=<name> [autoOffsetReset=<earliest|latest>] [isolation=<read_committed|read_uncommitted>] [batch=<N>] [wait_ms=<N>]
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Topic name (supports `*` and `?` wildcards) |
| partition | Yes | - | Partition ID |
| offset | Yes | - | Starting offset |
| member | Yes | - | Consumer member ID |
| group | No | default-group | Consumer group |
| autoOffsetReset | No | earliest | `earliest` (0) or `latest` (HWM) |
| isolation | No | read_committed | `read_committed` hides unresolved/aborted transactional records; `read_uncommitted` returns the raw committed log, including transaction metadata and control markers. |
| batch | No | 8192 | Max messages per poll |
| wait_ms | No | 0 | Long-poll timeout in ms |

Response: Binary batch frame (Section 5)

If the broker has a committed offset for `(topic, group, partition)`, `CONSUME`
starts from that committed offset even when the request includes a lower
`offset=` value. If no committed offset exists, the explicit `offset=` value is
used. If the command omits a usable explicit offset in a future protocol
revision, `autoOffsetReset=earliest` starts at `0` and `autoOffsetReset=latest`
starts at the partition high-water mark.

`CONSUME` is a stateless partition-leader read. The
partition leader does not validate consumer group ownership, member liveness, or
generation on the data path. Ownership and generation fencing are enforced by
coordinator commands such as `HEARTBEAT`, `COMMIT_OFFSET`, and `BATCH_COMMIT`.

**STREAM** (continuous push)
```
STREAM topic=<name> partition=<N> member=<id> group=<name> [isolation=<read_committed|read_uncommitted>] [batch=<N>]
```

Opens a continuous stream. Server pushes binary batches at ~100ms intervals. The connection stays open until the client disconnects, the broker removes the stream, the stream times out, or an unrecoverable stream error occurs. Like `CONSUME`, `STREAM` is a stateless partition-leader data path and does not validate group ownership or generation on every read. `STREAM` uses the same `isolation` contract as `CONSUME`; the default is `read_committed`.

Stream delivery never advances the consumer group's committed offset. Delivery to a TCP connection is not processing acknowledgement. After processing a batch, the client must explicitly send `COMMIT_OFFSET` or `BATCH_COMMIT` with its current member and generation.

Keepalive: Server sends `[00 00 00 00]` (4 zero bytes as length prefix) when no messages are available. Clients MUST treat zero-length frames as keepalive and continue reading.

Control frames: The broker may send UTF-8 text frames with the prefix `STREAM_CONTROL` on the same length-prefixed connection. Clients MUST inspect text control frames before binary batch decoding.

```text
STREAM_CONTROL type=CLOSE reason=<stopped|removed|timeout|error|offset_out_of_range> offset=<nextOffset>
```

`type=CLOSE` is a graceful stream terminator. `offset` is the broker's next stream offset at close time. `reason=offset_out_of_range` means the requested stream offset is older than the retained log. Clients SHOULD close the socket, keep or refresh their committed offset, and reconnect or rejoin according to the consumer group lifecycle. A broker crash, process kill, or network failure can still close the TCP connection without a terminator; clients MUST treat raw disconnect as retryable and resume from the broker committed offset.

#### Offset Management


**LIST_OFFSETS**

```text
LIST_OFFSETS topic=<name> [partition=<N>]
```

Success response:

```text
OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> offsets=P0:earliest=<N>:latest=<N>:leo=<N>:hwm=<N>,P1:earliest=<N>:latest=<N>:leo=<N>:hwm=<N>
```

`LIST_OFFSETS` returns the broker-side offset range for retained records. `earliest` is the first retained offset. `latest` is the next readable committed offset and is the value clients should use for `autoOffsetReset=latest`. `leo` is the partition log end offset, and `hwm` is the high-water mark before the broker caps reads to the flushed durable tail. A single `partition=` returns only that partition.

Errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic command=LIST_OFFSETS
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: invalid_partition command=LIST_OFFSETS
ERROR: partition_not_found partition=<N>
```

**FETCH_OFFSET**
```
FETCH_OFFSET topic=<name> partition=<N> group=<name>
```
Response: `OK offset=<nextOffset>`. If no offset has been committed, the broker returns `OK offset=0` (earliest). Older brokers returned a plain integer; clients may keep that only as a legacy fallback.

The key is `(topic, group, partition)`. Offsets are independent for every group
and every partition.

**COMMIT_OFFSET**
```
COMMIT_OFFSET topic=<name> partition=<N> group=<name> offset=<N> member=<actual-id> generation=<N>
```
Response: `OK`

The `offset` value is the next offset to read after the client has processed
records. Commits are durable and monotonic per `(topic, group, partition)`.
Committing the same offset is idempotent. Committing an offset lower than the
current committed offset returns an error and does not move the stored offset
backward. `member` and `generation` are required and must identify the current
partition owner; missing values are validation errors and stale values are fencing
errors.

**BATCH_COMMIT**
```
BATCH_COMMIT topic=<name> group=<name> member=<id> generation=<N> P<partition>:<offset>,P<partition>:<offset>,...
```
Example: `BATCH_COMMIT topic=t1 group=g1 member=m1 generation=3 P0:100,P1:200,P2:150`

Response: `OK batched=<N>`

> The `P` prefix before partition numbers is required.

Batch commits follow the same monotonic rule as `COMMIT_OFFSET` for each
included partition. The broker validates `member` and `generation` before applying
the batch. If any partition is not owned by that member in that generation, the
entire batch is rejected with `ERROR: NOT_OWNER ...`. Stale generations return
`ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH ...`, and unknown members return `ERROR: member_not_found ...`.
The whole batch is also rejected before any offset changes when `generation` is
missing, an entry is malformed, or the same partition appears more than once.


#### Transaction Coordinator

Cursus exposes a broker-managed transaction coordinator for consume-process-produce workflows. In distributed mode, each `transactional_id` maps to a stable logical coordinator shard. `transaction_coordinator_shards` selects the count when a cluster is first created and defaults to 50. Raft metadata persists the immutable count plus each shard's owner and coordinator epoch; a broker with a different configured count is rejected before joining. Clients can discover the current owner with `FIND_COORDINATOR transactional_id=<id>` and must retry on `ERROR: NOT_COORDINATOR host=<host> port=<port>`.

Standalone brokers append coordinator snapshots to `<log_dir>/__transaction_state.journal` and fsync each accepted transition. One encoded journal snapshot is limited to 32 MiB. Recovery truncates a torn or checksum-corrupt final journal record, rejects non-tail corruption, restores the latest state for each transactional id, and retries durable prepared work before the client listener becomes ready. Distributed brokers replicate the same snapshots through the Raft FSM as `TXN_SYNC`. Broker membership changes deterministically reassign coordinator shards and advance their epochs; only the current shard owner may persist v1 transaction transitions. The new owner resumes prepared work and timeout handling, while stale owner transitions and markers are fenced. Runtime transaction state is lock-sharded by the same logical shard mapping; prepared and deadline indexes restrict periodic recovery to owned shards and process candidates in bounded `transaction_recovery_batch_size` batches.

Negotiate `transactional_processing_v1` before `INIT_PRODUCER_ID` to select the exactly-once processing path. The broker returns the authoritative `(producerId, epoch)` session and bumps `epoch` on re-initialization to fence older producers. Open v1 transactions receive a deadline from `transaction_timeout_ms` (default 60000); the broker durably prepares and writes abort markers after timeout. After `transactional_id_expiration_ms`, completed transactions discard operation payloads but retain a compact epoch tombstone. Clients that do not negotiate the feature continue to use the compatible legacy staged-record path.

**INIT_PRODUCER_ID**

```text
INIT_PRODUCER_ID transactional_id=<id>
```

Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>`. Re-initializing the same `transactional_id` returns the same broker-managed `producerId` with a higher `epoch`, aborts any open local staging for that id, and fences commands that still use the previous epoch. If the transaction is already `committing`, the broker rejects reinitialization so the prepared commit can be retried or recovered.

**BEGIN_TXN**

```text
BEGIN_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>
```

Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> state=open producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>`. One initialized epoch may begin one transaction. After a successful commit or abort, another `BEGIN_TXN` with that epoch returns `ERROR: producer_reinitialization_required ...`; call `INIT_PRODUCER_ID` to obtain the next epoch. This does not prevent retrying an uncertain `END_TXN` with the original epoch.

**TXN_PUBLISH**

```text
TXN_PUBLISH transactional_id=<id> topic=<topic> [partition=<N>] producerId=<producer-id> seqNum=<N> epoch=<N> [key=<key>] message=<payload>
```

Success in v1: `OK transactional_id=<id> appended=true topic=<topic> partition=<N> state=open`.

In v1 the broker registers the participant durably, then appends the idempotent record immediately with `transaction_state=open`. It is invisible to `read_committed` until a matching commit marker and final coordinator decision exist. Abort and timeout append abort markers, so unresolved records never become visible. `seqNum` is required and makes publish retry idempotent even on a topic that was not created as globally idempotent.

**SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN**

```text
SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N> topic=<topic> group=<group> member=<member> generation=<N> P<partition>:<nextOffset>,P<partition>:<nextOffset>
```

Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> staged_offsets=<N>`.

The broker validates `member`, `generation`, group lifecycle epoch, topic-partition ownership, and monotonic offsets before staging, then revalidates them before commit. A v1 transaction may call this command for multiple topics, provided all offsets belong to the same `(group, member, generation, registrationEpoch)` session. Commit applies the complete multi-topic set under one membership fence. Repeating a topic-partition may only retain or advance its staged `nextOffset`.

**END_TXN**

```text
END_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N> result=<commit|abort>
```

Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> state=<committed|aborted> messages=<N> offsets=<N>`. Retrying the same final result with the same `producerId` and `epoch` is idempotent; a lower epoch is rejected as fenced, and trying to abort a committed transaction or commit an aborted transaction returns an error. Once commit preparation has durably entered `prepare_commit`, abort is rejected; clients must retry commit with the same producer session.

**TXN_STATUS**

```text
TXN_STATUS transactional_id=<id>
```

Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> mode=<legacy|transactional_processing_v1> state=<open|prepare_commit|prepare_abort|committed|aborted> messages=<N> participants=<N> offsets=<N>`.

Current guarantee: a successful transaction commit has one durable coordinator decision and follows this order:

1. validate participants and the fenced consumer-group offset scope while the transaction is still `open`,
2. append deterministic transactional offset snapshots to `__consumer_offsets` and register those partitions as transaction participants,
3. persist `prepare_commit`,
4. revalidate current topic, ownership, generation, and monotonic-offset fences,
5. append hidden commit markers to every touched output and offset partition,
6. persist the final `committed` coordinator decision, which exposes output and offsets together,
7. materialize committed offsets as ordinary revised snapshots for bounded transaction-state retention.

`read_committed` exposes a transaction only when its partition commit marker and current-epoch coordinator decision agree. Aborted records and control markers are skipped; the earliest unresolved transaction defines the stable visibility boundary. Partitions maintain an in-memory transaction index rebuilt from durable logs. For records created before durable coordinator decisions were stored, or for epochs no longer retained in the current coordinator snapshot, the durable partition marker remains the compatibility authority; every currently tracked epoch requires marker/decision agreement. Coordinator state is restored from the standalone fsynced journal or, in distributed mode, from `TXN_SYNC` and Raft metadata snapshots. A broker that restores a prepared state retries the corresponding commit or abort work; producer sequence state rebuilt from logs prevents duplicates. Retried finalization with the same epoch is idempotent.

The marker uses Cursus control metadata (`control_batch_type=transaction`, `control_batch_version=2`, `control_batch_coordinator_epoch=<epoch>`) and control-record bytes (`key: int16 version, int16 markerType`; `value: int16 version, int32 coordinatorEpoch`). For v1 distributed transactions this is the durable coordinator-shard epoch, independent of the producer epoch, so markers from a previous shard owner cannot authorize visibility. The transaction provides exactly-once processing for Cursus input offsets and Cursus output records in one broker transaction. External database, HTTP, filesystem, or service effects remain outside it and require application-level idempotency or their own transaction.
#### Event Sourcing Commands

These commands are available only on topics created with `event_sourcing=true`.

Event-sourcing commands are partition-routed by aggregate `key`. In distributed mode, `APPEND_STREAM`, `READ_STREAM`, `STREAM_VERSION`, `SAVE_SNAPSHOT`, and `READ_SNAPSHOT` must execute on the leader for the aggregate partition. A non-leader broker returns `ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>`; clients should reconnect to that address and retry. Followers index replicated event-sourcing messages, apply quorum-replicated snapshots, and rebuild local stream indexes from the committed log on restart. Partitions persist their high watermark checkpoint and restore it on broker restart so committed reads resume from the last successful committed tail.

**APPEND_STREAM**
```
APPEND_STREAM topic=<name> key=<aggregate_key> version=<N> event_type=<type> [schema_version=<N>] [metadata=<json>] message=<payload>
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Event-sourcing-enabled topic |
| key | Yes | - | Aggregate ID (determines partition routing) |
| version | Yes | - | Expected next version (must equal current version + 1) |
| event_type | No | "" | Event type name (e.g., `OrderCreated`) |
| schema_version | No | 1 | Schema version for upcasting |
| metadata | No | "" | Arbitrary JSON metadata |
| message | Yes | - | Event payload (captures rest of line) |

Success response: `OK version=<N> offset=<N> partition=<N>`

Internal broker catch-up commands: `LIST_SNAPSHOTS topic=<name> partition=<N>`, `FETCH_SNAPSHOT topic=<name> partition=<N> key=<aggregate_key>`, and `CATCHUP_SNAPSHOTS topic=<name> partition=<N> [leader=<host:port>]`. These commands are for broker-to-broker recovery only. In distributed mode, internal broker commands require `internal_token=<shared-token>` and brokers must be configured with `internal_auth_token`; clients and SDKs must not send these commands directly. Operators can additionally set `internal_broker_port` to move broker-to-broker command forwarding off the public client listener. When `internal_use_tls=true`, that internal listener requires mutual TLS using `internal_tls_cert_path`, `internal_tls_key_path`, and `internal_tls_ca_path`; the router dials peer brokers on the internal port with the same CA trust. The shared internal token remains a command-level guard, but mTLS/internal listener separation is the stronger network boundary.

Error responses:
- `ERROR: version_conflict current=<N> expected=<N>` — optimistic concurrency failure
- `ERROR: event_sourcing_not_enabled topic=<name>` - topic not created with `event_sourcing=true`
- `ERROR: invalid_schema_version` - `schema_version` was not an unsigned integer
- `ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>` - command reached a non-leader broker in distributed mode

**READ_STREAM**
```
READ_STREAM topic=<name> key=<aggregate_key> [from_version=<N>]
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| key | Yes | - | Aggregate ID |
| from_version | No | 1 | Positive starting version; a usable snapshot advances the event batch to snapshot version + 1 |

Response: Two length-prefixed frames sent sequentially.

Frame 1 — JSON envelope:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "topic": "orders",
  "key": "order-123",
  "partition": 2,
  "count": 5,
  "snapshot": {"version": 500, "payload": "..."}
}
```

The `snapshot` field is included only when a snapshot exists at or after `from_version`. `count` reflects the number of events in Frame 2 (not including the snapshot).

Frame 2 — Binary batch (standard 0xBA7C format) containing the events. If no events exist after the snapshot, the batch has message count 0. A missing, zero, or non-numeric `from_version` is handled as follows: missing defaults to `1`; zero or non-numeric values return a JSON error envelope with `error:"invalid_from_version"` and no batch frame.

**STREAM_VERSION**
```
STREAM_VERSION topic=<name> key=<aggregate_key>
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| key | Yes | - | Aggregate ID |

Response: `OK version=<N>` (for example, `OK version=6`). Returns `OK version=0` if the aggregate does not exist. Older brokers returned a plain integer; clients may keep that only as a legacy fallback.

**SAVE_SNAPSHOT**
```
SAVE_SNAPSHOT topic=<name> key=<aggregate_key> version=<N> message=<payload>
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| key | Yes | - | Aggregate ID |
| version | Yes | - | Aggregate version this snapshot represents (must be <= current version) |
| message | Yes | - | Serialized aggregate state (captures rest of line) |

Success response: `OK version=<N> partition=<N>`

In distributed mode, success means the leader stored the snapshot and replicated it to the configured in-sync replica quorum through the internal `REPLICATE_SNAPSHOT internal_token=<shared-token> payload=<json>` broker-to-broker command. Clients should not send `REPLICATE_SNAPSHOT` directly. Brokers reject internal commands without the configured token with `ERROR: internal_command_unauthorized ...`, and reject distributed-mode internal commands when no token is configured with `ERROR: internal_auth_not_configured ...`.

Error responses:
- `ERROR: snapshot_version_exceeds_stream version=<N> current=<N>`
- `ERROR: snapshot_replicate_failed reason="..."`

**READ_SNAPSHOT**
```
READ_SNAPSHOT topic=<name> key=<aggregate_key>
```
| Param | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | - | Portable topic name: 1-249 ASCII bytes using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| key | Yes | - | Aggregate ID |

Success response: `OK snapshot=<json>`
```text
OK snapshot={"version":500,"payload":"..."}
```

Not found response: `OK snapshot=null`. Older brokers returned `NULL`; clients may keep that only as a legacy fallback.

## 6. Consumer Group Protocol

### Lifecycle

```
1. JOIN_GROUP   → receive generation, member ID, initial assignments
2. SYNC_GROUP   → receive confirmed partition assignments
3. Loop:
   a. HEARTBEAT      (every 3s)
   b. CONSUME/STREAM (fetch messages)
   c. COMMIT_OFFSET  (periodically)
4. LEAVE_GROUP  → graceful exit
```

### Rebalancing

Rebalance is triggered when:
- A new consumer joins
- An existing consumer leaves or times out
- Partitions are added to the topic

Detection:
- `HEARTBEAT` returns `ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH ...`, `ERROR: member_not_found ...`, or another `ERROR:` response
- `COMMIT_OFFSET` or `BATCH_COMMIT` returns `ERROR: NOT_OWNER ...`, `ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH ...`, or `ERROR: member_not_found ...`

Client action:
1. Stop consuming.
2. Commit already processed offsets only while the member still owns those partitions.
3. Re-execute `JOIN_GROUP` then `SYNC_GROUP`.
4. Fetch broker committed offsets for the new assignments.
5. Resume consuming from those offsets.
### Offset Resolution Priority

```
1. Saved offset from coordinator for (topic, group, partition)
2. Explicit offset from request parameter
3. autoOffsetReset = "latest" → partition `LIST_OFFSETS latest` value
4. autoOffsetReset = "earliest" → 0
```

### SDK Offset and Group Contract

All SDKs should implement the same consumer group resume behavior:

- After `JOIN_GROUP` and `SYNC_GROUP`, fetch `FETCH_OFFSET` for every assigned partition before consuming.
- Treat the broker committed offset as the source of truth on reconnect, rejoin, and broker restart. SDK-local offset caches must not override a broker committed offset.
- Commit only after records have been processed. The committed value is `lastProcessedOffset + 1`.
- Send `member=<actual-id>` and `generation=<N>` on `COMMIT_OFFSET` when the SDK has group membership state.
- Send `BATCH_COMMIT` entries as `P<partition>:<nextOffset>` and include `member` plus `generation`.
- Treat `ERROR: offset_regression ...` as a failed commit; do not update local committed state from it.
- Treat `ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH ...`, `ERROR: NOT_OWNER ...`, and `ERROR: member_not_found ...` from `HEARTBEAT`, `COMMIT_OFFSET`, or `BATCH_COMMIT` as group membership failures that require stopping consumption and rejoining.
- On `ERROR: OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE ...`, apply the SDK `auto_offset_reset` policy: `earliest` resumes from the broker-reported earliest retained offset, `latest` resumes from the broker-reported latest offset, and `error` fails the consumer instead of silently skipping or replaying data.
### Offset Lifecycle and Delivery Guarantees

Consumer group registrations, tombstones, and committed next offsets are stored by the standalone broker in versioned records in `__consumer_offsets` and loaded again before readiness. A successful registration survives without a commit; `FETCH_OFFSET` returns `0` for its uncommitted partitions. Successful commits are synchronously persisted as monotonic complete snapshots, and the internal topic is compacted with unlimited retention rather than inheriting application delete retention. Replay corruption or inconsistency keeps readiness false and never falls back to an empty coordinator. Earlier single/bulk offset records remain readable. See [Standalone Storage Recovery](standalone-storage-recovery.md) for record and pre-manifest migration details.

In distributed mode, offset updates are also applied through the Raft FSM and included in FSM snapshots.

Recommended client loop:

1. Fetch or join/sync assignments.
2. Consume from the broker-selected resume offset.
3. Process the returned records.
4. Commit `lastProcessedOffset + 1` using `COMMIT_OFFSET ... member=<id> generation=<N>` or `BATCH_COMMIT ... P<partition>:<nextOffset>`.

This gives at-least-once delivery when the client commits after processing. If a
client commits before processing and then crashes, it may skip unprocessed
records, which is at-most-once behavior for that client. Cursus provides broker-managed transaction commands for consume-process-produce workflows, including producer fencing, durable transaction state, idempotent finalization, hidden partition transaction markers with durable transaction control-record key/value bytes and Cursus control-batch metadata, startup recovery for prepared commits, and read-committed filtering with a stable visibility boundary for unresolved open transactions. It is still not exactly-once for external effects, so applications that need exactly-once external effects must still make their processors idempotent or transactional outside the broker.

Example for a game server such as wargame-IOCP:

```
JOIN_GROUP topic=match-events group=wargame-iocp member=game-01
SYNC_GROUP topic=match-events group=wargame-iocp member=game-01-1234
FETCH_OFFSET topic=match-events partition=0 group=wargame-iocp
# broker returns: OK offset=<nextOffset>
CONSUME topic=match-events partition=0 offset=<nextOffset> group=wargame-iocp member=game-01-1234 batch=128
COMMIT_OFFSET topic=match-events partition=0 group=wargame-iocp offset=<lastProcessedOffset+1>
```

The game server does not need its own Postgres table for Cursus offsets once it
uses this API. On reconnect or broker restart, the same group resumes from the
last successful broker commit.

---

## 7. Error Handling

### Error Response Format

Without feature negotiation, the backward-compatible response is:

```text
ERROR: <code> [key=value ...]
```

After negotiating `structured_errors_v1`, every text error generated for that connection includes classification metadata directly after the code:

```text
ERROR: <code> class=<class> retryable=<true|false> [key=value ...]
```

`retryable=true` means the same logical operation may be attempted again after applying the response instructions, such as reconnecting to the advertised leader or waiting for coordinator availability. `retryable=false` means blindly repeating the same request is not valid; the client may still recover by changing state, rejoining a group, correcting input, or obtaining authorization.

| Class | Meaning | Typical client action |
|-------|---------|-----------------------|
| `routing` | Request reached the wrong broker | Follow redirect metadata and retry |
| `availability` | Required broker subsystem is temporarily unavailable | Back off and retry |
| `fencing` | Producer epoch, group generation, member, or ownership is stale | Recreate producer state or rejoin; do not repeat unchanged request |
| `conflict` | Request conflicts with authoritative state | Refresh state and decide whether to issue a changed request |
| `authorization` | Principal or topic policy denied the operation | Fail closed |
| `not_found` | Requested resource does not exist | Create or select a valid resource |
| `validation` | Command syntax or value is invalid | Correct the request |
| `internal` | Broker could not classify a safe recovery action | Fail closed and surface diagnostics |

SDKs should parse the code and fields first, use `class` for broad handling, and use `retryable` only as a retry eligibility signal. They must still apply bounded backoff and must never retry a non-idempotent operation unless its command contract makes the retry safe. The broker's authoritative code-to-class registry is implemented in `pkg/protocol`; a coverage test fails when a new static `ERROR:` emission is added without a registry entry.

### Error Codes

| Error | Cause | Client Action |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `invalid_topic_name topic=<X>` | Topic name violates the portable storage contract | Use 1-249 ASCII bytes containing letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `=` |
| `topic_not_found topic=<X>` | Topic not created | CREATE topic first |
| `PARTITION_NOT_FOUND <N>` | Invalid partition ID | Check DESCRIBE for valid IDs |
| `TOPIC_NOT_FOUND <X>` | Topic not found | CREATE topic first |
| `NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_PARTITION <T>:<P>` | Not partition leader | Redirect to correct leader |
| `NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <addr>` | Not Raft leader | Reconnect to specified address |
| `group_not_found group=<X>` | Group not registered | JOIN_GROUP or REGISTER_GROUP |
| `topic_not_assigned_to_group` | Topic mismatch | Verify group registration |
| `GEN_MISMATCH current=N requested=N group=<G> member=<M>` | Stale generation | Re-join group |
| `NOT_OWNER partition=N member=<M> group=<G> generation=N` | Assignment changed | Re-join group |

| `offset_regression reason="..."` | Commit lower than current stored offset | Treat commit as failed; refetch offset |
| `stale_producer_epoch producer=<id> current=<N> got=<N>` | Idempotent producer request uses an older fenced epoch | Treat as fatal for that producer instance; create a new producer session |
| `producer_reinitialization_required transactional_id=<id> epoch=<N>` | A completed epoch attempted to begin another transaction | Call `INIT_PRODUCER_ID`, then begin with the returned higher epoch; retain the old epoch only for uncertain finalization retry |
| `OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE requested=N earliest=N latest=N` | Requested offset is older than retained log or beyond available range | Treat as data loss or reset according to policy |
| `no_valid_offsets` | BATCH_COMMIT contains no usable offsets | Supply at least one `P<N>:<offset>` entry |
| `missing_generation command=<command>` | Group command omitted its generation | Rejoin if needed and send the current generation |
| `invalid_batch_commit_entry entry=<entry>` | BATCH_COMMIT entry is not `P<N>:<offset>` | Correct the malformed entry and retry |
| `duplicate_partition partition=N group=<G> topic=<T>` | BATCH_COMMIT repeats a partition | Send one next offset per partition; no offsets were committed |
| `NOT_PARTITION_LEADER leader=<id> requested_leader=<id>` | Replication reached a broker that is not the current partition leader | Refresh partition metadata and retry against the leader |
| `STALE_LEADER_EPOCH current=N requested=N` | Replication request carries a fenced leader epoch | Discard the stale leader session and refresh metadata |
| `cluster_metadata_unavailable command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE` | Cluster metadata subsystem is temporarily unavailable | Back off and retry |
| `partition_metadata_not_found topic=<T> partition=N` | Partition metadata does not exist | Refresh metadata and verify topic/partition |
| `missing_leader_fence command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE` | Internal replication omitted leader ID or epoch | Correct the broker request; do not retry unchanged |
| `invalid_commit_watermark reason="..."` | Commit watermark is ahead of local durable data or otherwise invalid | Repair/catch up the replica before retrying |
| `replica_index_prepare_failed reason="..."` | The follower could not prepare its committed event-stream index before HWM advancement | Repair the local index/storage error and retry the HWM commit |
| invalid_control_batch_bytes field=<key|value> | Broker-internal transaction control bytes are not valid base64 | Reject the internal publish and inspect broker compatibility |
| `version_conflict current=N expected=N` | Optimistic concurrency failure | Reload aggregate and retry |
| `event_sourcing_not_enabled topic=<X>` | ES command on non-ES topic | CREATE topic with `event_sourcing=true` |
| `snapshot_version_exceeds_stream version=N current=N` | Invalid snapshot version | Use version <= current stream version |

### Leader Redirect

In distributed mode, if a request reaches a non-leader broker:

```
ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS 192.168.1.10:9000
```

Client should reconnect to the specified address and retry.

---

## 8. Topic Policy Contract

### Authorization

The wire protocol exposes per-topic `auth_policy` metadata: `open`, `deny_write`, `deny_read`, and `acl`. When `enable_sasl=true`, all protected admin, topic, group, and transaction commands require connection authentication with `AUTH principal=<principal> token=<token>` or inline `principal=<principal> auth_token=<token>`.

Configured users may receive `admin`, `topic.read`, `topic.write`, `group`, `transaction`, or wildcard `*` permissions. Commands that cross boundaries require every applicable permission: `CONSUME`/`STREAM` require `topic.read` plus `group`, `TXN_PUBLISH` requires `transaction` plus `topic.write`, and `SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN` requires `transaction` plus `group`. Missing authentication returns `ERROR: authentication_required command=<COMMAND>`; insufficient coarse permission returns `ERROR: NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_OPERATION command=<COMMAND> permission=<permission>`.

After coarse authorization, `auth_policy=acl` checks `read_acl` for topic reads and `write_acl` for topic writes, returning `ERROR: NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_TOPIC topic=<T> operation=<read|write>` on denial. Internal broker contexts bypass client permissions but remain subject to the separate internal-listener/token boundary. This is a token authentication contract, not a mechanism-specific SASL byte protocol; use TLS/mTLS and network controls across trust boundaries. An omitted `permissions` list retains legacy full access for an authenticated user and should be avoided in least-privilege deployments.

### Retention

Topics store `retention_hours` and `retention_bytes` policy metadata. A value of `0` means the broker-level default applies. Enforcement is still performed by the broker storage/retention loop, and retention-gap reads return `ERROR: OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE requested=<N> earliest=<N> latest=<N>` instead of an empty batch. Clients should treat this as data loss for that group and recover according to application policy, such as alerting, resetting to `earliest`, or rebuilding from another source.

### Partition Keys

`partitioner=hash_key` routes keyed messages with FNV-1a 64-bit hash modulo the topic partition count and routes unkeyed messages round-robin. `partitioner=round_robin` ignores message keys and routes every publish by round-robin. Increasing partition count can remap future records for an existing key.

---

## 9. Idempotent Producer

### Enable

Set `isIdempotent=true` on PUBLISH or in binary batch header.

### Requirements

- Each idempotent message must have a unique `(producerId, epoch, seqNum)` tuple within a partition
- `seqNum` must be monotonically increasing within the current producer epoch for each partition
- A new `(producerId, epoch)` sequence starts at `seqNum=1`; starting above 1 is rejected as a gap
- A higher `epoch` fences the previous producer session and may restart `seqNum` from 1
- A lower `epoch` is rejected as stale producer state
- `seqNum` = 0 disables dedup for non-transactional publish messages; transactional `TXN_PUBLISH` requires `seqNum > 0`
- Broker rejects duplicates silently (returns OK)

### Sequence Tracking

- Broker tracks the last seen `(epoch, seqNum)` per `(producerId)` per partition
- Disk-backed partitions persist producer sequence checkpoints, rebuild producer state from partition logs on broker restart, and use that state to make transactional commit recovery idempotent
- Distributed FSM snapshots also include producer sequence state for replicated message commands
- Producer epochs entered FSM snapshot version 3, transaction state version 4, committed partition watermarks version 5, durable topic definitions version 6, transaction coordinator shard ownership version 7, and the immutable shard count version 8. Version 7 and older snapshots restore with the historical count of 50. Current brokers write version 8. Do not run a mixed-version rolling upgrade with binaries that cannot decode version 8; upgrade the cluster together or use an explicitly documented compatibility procedure.
- Producer state expires from memory after `producer_state_ttl_ms` of inactivity (default 30 minutes); durable checkpoints retain the last persisted sequence until the partition data is removed
