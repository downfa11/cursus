# API Reference

This document summarizes the Cursus TCP command API. The canonical response contract is defined in [Protocol Specification](../protocol-spec.md); this page is a command-oriented quick reference.

Cursus uses a length-prefixed TCP protocol. Every command request and text response is encoded as:

```text
[4-byte big-endian length][payload]
```

`CONSUME`, `STREAM`, and `READ_STREAM` are data-plane commands and can return one or more length-prefixed binary frames. Other control-plane commands return a single text or JSON response frame.

## Response Contract

Control-plane commands use one of these response forms:

```text
OK
OK key=value [key=value ...]
{"status":"OK", ...}
ERROR: <code> [key=value ...]
```

Clients should treat `OK`, `OK ...`, and JSON responses with `status:"OK"` as success. Clients should treat every `ERROR:` response as failure and branch on the machine-readable error code immediately after the prefix.

Legacy natural-language responses such as `Topic '<name>' now has <N> partitions`, `(no topics)`, or plain integer offsets are deprecated. SDKs may keep narrow fallback parsers for older brokers, but new client code should use the structured contract above.

## Protocol Commands

### PROTOCOL_INFO

```text
PROTOCOL_INFO
```

Returns the supported wire protocol range, default version, feature names, and structured error classes without changing connection state:

```text
OK protocol=cursus min_version=1 max_version=1 default_version=1 features=<csv> error_classes=<csv>
```

### NEGOTIATE

```text
NEGOTIATE version=<N> [features=<csv|*>] [require_features=<true|false>]
```

Negotiation applies only to the current TCP connection. Success returns:

```text
OK protocol_version=<N> enabled=<csv> unsupported=<csv>
```

With `structured_errors_v1` enabled, subsequent text errors use `ERROR: <code> class=<class> retryable=<bool> ...`. Existing clients that do not negotiate retain the previous response shape. Clients opening multiple data, coordinator, or partition connections must negotiate each connection independently.

## Topic Commands

### CREATE

```text
CREATE topic=<name> [partitions=<N>] [idempotent=<bool>] [event_sourcing=<bool>] [replication_factor=<N>] [cleanup_policy=<delete|compact|delete,compact>] [retention_hours=<N>] [retention_bytes=<N>] [partitioner=<hash_key|round_robin>] [auth_policy=<open|deny_write|deny_read|acl>] [read_acl=<principal[,principal]>] [write_acl=<principal[,principal]>]
```

Creates a topic or increases its partition count when the topic already exists.

Success:

```text
OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> cleanup_policy=<policy> partitioner=<policy> auth_policy=<policy> read_acl=<csv> write_acl=<csv> retention_hours=<N> retention_bytes=<N>
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic expected="CREATE topic=<name> [partitions=<N>]"
ERROR: invalid_topic_name topic=<name> reason="..."
ERROR: invalid_partitions reason="must be a positive integer"
ERROR: invalid_replication_factor reason="must be a positive integer"
ERROR: invalid_topic_policy field=cleanup_policy reason="..."
ERROR: unsupported_topic_policy field=cleanup_policy reason="..."
ERROR: create_topic_failed reason="..."
```

### DELETE

```text
DELETE topic=<name>
```

Success:

```text
OK topic=<name> deleted=true
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic expected="DELETE topic=<name>"
ERROR: invalid_topic_name topic=<name> reason="..."
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: delete_topic_failed reason="..."
```

### LIST

```text
LIST
```

Success:

```text
OK count=<N> topics=<comma-separated-topic-names>
```

When no topics exist, the broker returns:

```text
OK count=0 topics=
```

### DESCRIBE

```text
DESCRIBE topic=<name>
```

Success is a JSON topic metadata object with `status:"OK"`.

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic expected="DESCRIBE topic=<name>"
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: marshal_metadata_failed reason="..."
```

### HELP

```text
HELP
```

Success:

```text
OK commands=<comma-separated-command-names>
```

## Publish Commands

### PUBLISH

```text
PUBLISH topic=<name> [partition=<N>] [key=<routing-key>] [producerId=<id>] [seqNum=<N>] [epoch=<N>] [isIdempotent=<bool>] [acks=0|1|all] message=<payload>
```

Because `message=` captures the rest of the line, put optional parameters before `message=`.

Transaction metadata fields are not accepted on client `PUBLISH`; use the transaction commands for transactional records. Direct `transactional_id`, `transaction_state`, or `transaction_marker` injection returns `ERROR: transaction_metadata_forbidden command=PUBLISH`.

For `acks=1` or `acks=all`, success is a JSON ack response with `status:"OK"`. Text `PUBLISH` may include `partition=<N>` to target a partition explicitly; otherwise the topic partition policy selects the partition. Idempotent publish uses `(producerId, epoch, seqNum)` per partition: each new `(producerId, epoch)` sequence starts at `seqNum=1`, higher epochs fence older producer sessions, lower epochs are rejected as stale, and `seqNum=0` disables dedup for that message. Producer epochs entered FSM snapshot version 3; current brokers write version 8 with transaction state, committed partition watermarks, durable topic definitions, transaction coordinator shard ownership, and its immutable cluster shard count. Version 7 and older snapshots use the historical count of 50. Avoid mixed-version rolling upgrades with binaries that cannot decode version 8. For `acks=0`, success is:

```text
OK
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic command=PUBLISH
ERROR: missing_message command=PUBLISH
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: partition_not_found partition=<N>
ERROR: invalid_acks value=<value>
ERROR: invalid_seq_num reason="..."
ERROR: invalid_epoch reason="..."
ERROR: stale_producer_epoch reason="..."
```

### REPLICATE_MESSAGE

Internal replication command used between brokers. In distributed mode this command requires `internal_token=<shared-token>` before `payload=`. External clients and SDKs must not call it directly.

Success:

```text
OK
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: internal_auth_not_configured command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE
ERROR: internal_command_unauthorized command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE
ERROR: missing_payload command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE
ERROR: unmarshal_failed reason="..."
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: partition_not_found partition=<N>
ERROR: cluster_metadata_unavailable command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE
ERROR: partition_metadata_not_found topic=<name> partition=<N>
ERROR: missing_leader_fence command=REPLICATE_MESSAGE
ERROR: NOT_PARTITION_LEADER leader=<broker-id> requested_leader=<broker-id>
ERROR: STALE_LEADER_EPOCH current=<N> requested=<N>
ERROR: invalid_commit_watermark reason="..."
ERROR: replica_append_failed reason="..."
ERROR: replica_index_prepare_failed reason="..."
ERROR: replica_index_failed reason="..."
```

## Consume Commands

### CONSUME

```text
CONSUME topic=<name> group=<group> partition=<N> offset=<N> member=<member-id> [isolation=<read_committed|read_uncommitted>] [batch=<N>]
```

`CONSUME` returns binary message frames. For consumer groups, the broker uses the committed offset for `(topic, group, partition)` as the authoritative resume point when one exists; otherwise the earliest offset policy is `0`. `CONSUME` is a stateless partition-leader read: ownership, liveness, and generation fencing are enforced by coordinator commands, not on the data path. The default isolation is `read_committed`, which hides unresolved and aborted transactional records. `isolation=read_uncommitted` returns the raw committed log, including transaction metadata and control markers.

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: invalid_consume_syntax
ERROR: missing_topic command=CONSUME
ERROR: missing_partition command=CONSUME
ERROR: missing_offset command=CONSUME
ERROR: missing_member command=CONSUME
ERROR: invalid_partition
ERROR: invalid_offset
ERROR: invalid_isolation isolation=<value>
ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>
ERROR: OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE requested=<N> earliest=<N> latest=<N>
```

### STREAM

Continuous push-mode consume command.

```text
STREAM topic=<name> group=<group> partition=<N> offset=<N> member=<member-id> [isolation=<read_committed|read_uncommitted>]
```

`STREAM` returns one or more length-prefixed frames:

```text
[binary batch frame]
[00 00 00 00]                                  # zero-length keepalive
STREAM_CONTROL type=CLOSE reason=<stopped|removed|timeout|error|offset_out_of_range> offset=<nextOffset>
```

Clients must treat zero-length frames as keepalive. Like `CONSUME`, `STREAM` is a stateless partition-leader data path and does not validate group ownership or generation on every read. `STREAM` uses the same `isolation` contract as `CONSUME`; the default is `read_committed`. A `STREAM_CONTROL type=CLOSE` frame is a graceful terminator; `reason=offset_out_of_range` means the requested stream offset is older than the retained log. Clients should close the socket and resume through the consumer group offset contract or reset according to policy. Raw TCP disconnect without a close control frame remains possible on broker crash or network failure and should be treated as retryable.

The broker does not commit offsets when records are written to a stream socket or when the stream closes. The client must commit the next offset explicitly after processing, using its current member and generation. This keeps stream delivery consistent with the at-least-once consumer-group contract.

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: invalid_stream_syntax
ERROR: missing_topic command=STREAM
ERROR: missing_partition command=STREAM
ERROR: missing_offset command=STREAM
ERROR: missing_member command=STREAM
ERROR: invalid_isolation isolation=<value>
ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>
```

## Consumer Group Commands

### REGISTER_GROUP

```text
REGISTER_GROUP topic=<name> group=<group>
REGISTER_GROUP topics=<topic-1>,<topic-2>[,...] group=<group>
REGISTER_GROUP pattern=<glob> group=<group>
```

Success:

```text
OK group=<group> topic=<name> registered=true
```

The multi-topic forms require `consumer_group_subscriptions_v1`. They durably register the concrete topic-partition expansion. Multi-topic members omit `topic` from `JOIN_GROUP`/`SYNC_GROUP` and receive `topic_assignments=<topic>:P<partition>,...`.

### JOIN_GROUP

```text
JOIN_GROUP topic=<name> group=<group> member=<member-id>
```

Success:

```text
OK member=<assigned-member-id> generation=<N>
```

### SYNC_GROUP

```text
SYNC_GROUP topic=<name> group=<group> member=<assigned-member-id>
```

Success:

```text
OK member=<assigned-member-id> generation=<N> assignments=<partition-list>
```

### HEARTBEAT

```text
HEARTBEAT topic=<name> group=<group> member=<assigned-member-id> [generation=<N>]
```

Success:

```text
OK member=<assigned-member-id> generation=<N>
```

### LEAVE_GROUP

```text
LEAVE_GROUP topic=<name> group=<group> member=<assigned-member-id>
```

Success:

```text
OK group=<group> member=<assigned-member-id> left=true
```


### LIST_OFFSETS

```text
LIST_OFFSETS topic=<name> [partition=<N>]
```

Returns retained and readable offset bounds for all partitions or one partition.

```text
OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> offsets=P0:earliest=<N>:latest=<N>:leo=<N>:hwm=<N>,P1:earliest=<N>:latest=<N>:leo=<N>:hwm=<N>
```

`latest` is the next readable committed offset and is the value SDKs should use for `auto_offset_reset=latest`. `leo` is the log end offset, and `hwm` is the high-water mark before the broker caps reads to the flushed durable tail.

Errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic command=LIST_OFFSETS
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: invalid_partition command=LIST_OFFSETS
ERROR: partition_not_found partition=<N>
```

### FETCH_OFFSET

```text
FETCH_OFFSET topic=<name> group=<group> partition=<N>
```

Success:

```text
OK offset=<nextOffset>
```

When no offset has been committed, the broker returns `OK offset=0`.

### COMMIT_OFFSET

```text
COMMIT_OFFSET topic=<name> group=<group> partition=<N> offset=<nextOffset> member=<member-id> generation=<N>
```

The offset is the next offset to read after successful processing. Commits are monotonic per `(topic, group, partition)`: a commit lower than the current offset fails and does not rewind the group. `member` and `generation` are required, and the member must own the partition in that generation.

Success:

```text
OK
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: invalid_offset
ERROR: missing_generation command=COMMIT_OFFSET
ERROR: invalid_generation command=COMMIT_OFFSET
ERROR: offset_regression reason="..."
ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH current=<N> requested=<N> group=<group> member=<member-id>
ERROR: NOT_OWNER partition=<N> member=<member-id> group=<group> generation=<N>
ERROR: member_not_found member=<member-id> group=<group>
ERROR: offset_manager_not_available
ERROR: commit_offset_failed reason="..."
```
### BATCH_COMMIT

```text
BATCH_COMMIT topic=<name> group=<group> member=<member-id> generation=<N> P0:<nextOffset>,P1:<nextOffset>
```

Success:

```text
OK batched=<N>
```

The `P` prefix in each partition entry is required. The broker validates `member` and `generation` before applying the batch and rejects the whole batch if any partition is no longer owned by that member.

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: invalid_batch_commit_format
ERROR: invalid_batch_commit_entry entry=<entry>
ERROR: missing_generation command=BATCH_COMMIT
ERROR: invalid_generation command=BATCH_COMMIT
ERROR: duplicate_partition partition=<N> group=<group> topic=<topic>
ERROR: no_valid_offsets
ERROR: offset_regression reason="..."
ERROR: GEN_MISMATCH current=<N> requested=<N> group=<group> member=<member-id>
ERROR: NOT_OWNER partition=<N> member=<member-id> group=<group> generation=<N>
ERROR: member_not_found member=<member-id> group=<group>
ERROR: offset_manager_not_available
ERROR: bulk_commit_failed reason="..."
```
### GROUP_STATUS

```text
GROUP_STATUS group=<group>
```

Success is a JSON group status response with `status:"OK"`.

### FIND_COORDINATOR

```text
FIND_COORDINATOR group=<group>
```

Success:

```text
OK host=<host> port=<port>
```

In distributed mode, non-coordinator brokers can return:

```text
ERROR: NOT_COORDINATOR host=<host> port=<port>
```

## Cluster Commands

### METADATA

```text
METADATA topic=<name>
```

Success is a text response:

```text
OK topic=<name> partitions=<N> leaders=<csv> epochs=<csv> cleanup_policy=<policy> partitioner=<policy> auth_policy=<policy> read_acl=<csv> write_acl=<csv> retention_hours=<N> retention_bytes=<N>
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic command=METADATA
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: fsm_not_available
ERROR: distribution_not_enabled
```

### CLUSTER_STATUS

`CLUSTER_STATUS` returns `OK cluster=<json>` in distributed mode. The JSON document contains the Raft leader address, active/inactive broker counts, partition leader epochs and committed HWMs, plus leaderless and under-replicated partition totals. A leader is considered available only when its registered broker is active.

Common errors are `ERROR: distribution_required command=CLUSTER_STATUS`, `ERROR: fsm_not_available command=CLUSTER_STATUS`, and `ERROR: marshal_cluster_status_failed reason="..."`.

### ELECT_LEADER

`ELECT_LEADER topic=<name> partition=<N> broker=<broker-id>` performs a controlled preferred-leader change through the Raft metadata log. The target must be an active replica already present in the partition ISR. The broker records the current leader epoch in the command and the FSM rejects stale concurrent changes. A successful change increments `leader_epoch` while preserving `committed_hwm`, replicas, and ISR. Retrying an election whose target is already leader succeeds with `changed=false` and does not advance the epoch again.

Success:

```text
OK topic=<name> partition=<N> previous_leader=<broker-id> leader=<broker-id> leader_epoch=<N> changed=<true|false>
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: distribution_required command=ELECT_LEADER
ERROR: missing_broker command=ELECT_LEADER
ERROR: partition_not_found topic=<name> partition=<N>
ERROR: leader_election_rejected topic=<name> partition=<N> broker=<id> reason="..."
ERROR: leader_election_result_unavailable topic=<name> partition=<N>
```

This command does not add replicas, expand ISR, or perform data movement. Reassignment and broker draining require a separate catch-up-aware workflow.

### RAFT_APPLY

Internal replication command used by distributed brokers. In distributed mode this command requires `internal_token=<shared-token>` before `type=`. External clients and SDKs must not call it directly.

Success:

```text
OK
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: internal_auth_not_configured command=RAFT_APPLY
ERROR: internal_command_unauthorized command=RAFT_APPLY
ERROR: missing_required_params command=RAFT_APPLY params=type,payload
ERROR: empty_required_params command=RAFT_APPLY params=type,payload
ERROR: distribution_required command=RAFT_APPLY
ERROR: invalid_payload_json reason="..."
ERROR: raft_apply_failed reason="..."
```

## Event Sourcing Commands

Event-sourcing commands are routed by aggregate `key`. In distributed mode, the broker handling the command must be the leader for the aggregate partition. A non-leader broker returns:

```text
ERROR: NOT_LEADER LEADER_IS <host:port>
```

Clients and SDKs should reconnect to that leader and retry. Followers index replicated event-sourcing records, apply quorum-replicated snapshots, and can pull missing snapshots from the partition leader with token-authenticated internal catch-up commands after restart. Partitions restore a synced high-watermark checkpoint with durable-tail clamping, so committed reads remain bounded by the last successful committed tail.



### INIT_PRODUCER_ID

```text
INIT_PRODUCER_ID transactional_id=<id>
```

Initializes or reinitializes a broker-managed producer session for a transactional id. Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>`. Reinitialization bumps `epoch` and fences older producers for that `transactional_id`. If the transaction is already `committing`, the broker rejects reinitialization so the prepared commit can be retried or recovered. After `transactional_id_expiration_ms`, completed transactions discard staged payloads but retain a compact producer-epoch tombstone in coordinator snapshots. Active `open` and `committing` transactions remain available for recovery.

### BEGIN_TXN

```text
BEGIN_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>
```

Starts a broker-managed transaction using the `producerId` and `epoch` returned by `INIT_PRODUCER_ID`. In distributed mode, `transactional_id` maps to a durable logical coordinator shard; route transaction commands to the owner returned by `FIND_COORDINATOR transactional_id=<id>`. Shard ownership changes advance a coordinator epoch that fences the previous owner. Success: `OK transactional_id=<id> state=open producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N>`. One initialized epoch may begin one transaction. After commit or abort, call `INIT_PRODUCER_ID` before the next begin; otherwise the broker returns `producer_reinitialization_required`. An uncertain `END_TXN` may still be retried with the completed epoch.

### TXN_PUBLISH

```text
TXN_PUBLISH transactional_id=<id> topic=<topic> [partition=<N>] producerId=<producer-id> seqNum=<N> epoch=<N> [key=<key>] message=<payload>
```

With `transactional_processing_v1`, appends one unresolved record immediately through the normal partition-leader path. `seqNum` is required and makes retries idempotent even on non-idempotent topics. The record remains invisible to `read_committed` until its commit marker and final coordinator decision agree. Explicit abort and `transaction_timeout_ms` timeout resolution append abort markers. The producer and epoch must match `BEGIN_TXN`; stale epochs are fenced.

### SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN

```text
SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N> topic=<topic> group=<group> member=<member> generation=<N> P<partition>:<nextOffset>,P<partition>:<nextOffset>
```

Stages consumer offsets in the transaction. The broker validates group member, generation, lifecycle epoch, topic-partition ownership, and monotonic offsets at stage and commit time. V1 callers may repeat this command for multiple topics in the same `(group, member, generation, registrationEpoch)` session. Finalization applies the complete set atomically under one membership fence.

### END_TXN

```text
END_TXN transactional_id=<id> producerId=<producer-id> epoch=<N> result=<commit|abort>
```

V1 commit validates the transaction, persists `prepare_commit`, applies all staged source offsets, appends output commit markers, and persists `committed`. The ordering keeps output invisible until its input position is durable. Abort persists `prepare_abort`, appends abort markers, and persists `aborted`; the timeout monitor uses the same path. Recovery retries either prepared state on its current coordinator-shard owner. Ownership and timeout work are distributed across active brokers, and the marker's durable coordinator-shard epoch rejects stale owners after reassignment independently of producer fencing. Repeated finalization is idempotent. This provides exactly-once processing for Cursus source offsets and Cursus output records, not external side effects.

### TXN_STATUS

```text
TXN_STATUS transactional_id=<id>
```

Returns transaction state and staged operation counts.

### APPEND_STREAM

```text
APPEND_STREAM topic=<name> key=<aggregate-key> version=<N> [event_type=<type>] [schema_version=<N>] [metadata=<json>] message=<payload>
```

Success:

```text
OK version=<N> offset=<N> partition=<N>
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: missing_topic
ERROR: missing_key
ERROR: missing_version
ERROR: invalid_version
ERROR: missing_message
ERROR: topic_not_found topic=<name>
ERROR: event_sourcing_not_enabled topic=<name>
ERROR: version_conflict current=<N> expected=<N>
ERROR: append_stream_failed reason="..."
```

### READ_STREAM

```text
READ_STREAM topic=<name> key=<aggregate-key> [from_version=<N>]
```

Success returns a JSON envelope frame with `status:"OK"`, followed by a binary batch frame containing committed events. Error envelopes use JSON with `status:"ERROR"`. `from_version` must be a positive integer; invalid values return `invalid_from_version`.

### STREAM_VERSION

```text
STREAM_VERSION topic=<name> key=<aggregate-key>
```

Success:

```text
OK version=<N>
```

### SAVE_SNAPSHOT

```text
SAVE_SNAPSHOT topic=<name> key=<aggregate-key> version=<N> message=<payload>
```

Success:

```text
OK version=<N> partition=<N>
```

Common errors:

```text
ERROR: snapshot_version_exceeds_stream version=<N> current=<N>
ERROR: snapshot_save_failed reason="..."
```

### READ_SNAPSHOT

```text
READ_SNAPSHOT topic=<name> key=<aggregate-key>
```

Success when a snapshot exists:

```text
OK snapshot={"version":500,"payload":"..."}
```

Success when no snapshot exists:

```text
OK snapshot=null
```


## Topic Policy Notes

- With `enable_sasl=true`, protected commands require connection or inline authentication. Users may declare `admin`, `topic.read`, `topic.write`, `group`, `transaction`, or `*` permissions; cross-boundary commands require every applicable permission. Missing authentication returns `authentication_required`, and missing coarse permission returns `NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_OPERATION`. Per-topic `auth_policy=acl` is evaluated afterward with `read_acl`/`write_acl` and returns `NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_TOPIC` on denial. Omitting a user permission list preserves legacy full authenticated access. This is a token contract, not a mechanism-specific SASL byte protocol; use TLS/mTLS and network controls for broker exposure.
- Topics expose `retention_hours` and `retention_bytes` policy metadata. `0` means broker default. Reads before the earliest retained offset fail with `ERROR: OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE requested=<N> earliest=<N> latest=<N>`. SDKs should apply `auto_offset_reset` (`earliest`, `latest`, or `error`) to decide whether to reset or fail; `latest` should use `LIST_OFFSETS latest`, the next readable committed offset.
- `partitioner=hash_key` uses FNV-1a 64-bit hash modulo partition count for keyed messages and round-robin for missing keys. `partitioner=round_robin` ignores keys. Increasing partition count can remap future records for an existing key.

## Server-Level Errors

Malformed frames and handler failures also use the same error prefix:

```text
ERROR: decode_failed reason="..."
ERROR: malformed_input reason=missing_topic_or_payload
ERROR: command_failed reason="..."
ERROR: empty_command_response
ERROR: unknown_command command=<name>
ERROR: empty_command
```
