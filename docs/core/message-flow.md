# Message Flow

Cursus has a durable partition-log data path and separate coordinator control paths. The in-process subscription channels are an optimization/API for embedded consumers; network consumers use `CONSUME` or `STREAM` against partition logs.

## Normal Publish

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Producer
    participant B as Broker controller
    participant T as Topic/Partition leader
    participant D as DiskHandler
    participant R as Replicas

    C->>B: PUBLISH topic=... key=... message=...
    B->>B: authenticate, authorize, parse policy
    B->>T: route to partition leader
    T->>T: producer epoch/sequence and dedup checks
    T->>D: append assigned offset
    D-->>T: local write result
    T->>R: replicate with leader/epoch fence
    R-->>T: ISR/quorum result
    T->>T: advance committed HWM
    T-->>C: OK/ack with assigned offset
```

Keyed records use FNV-1a 64-bit hash modulo partition count when the topic policy is `hash_key`; unkeyed records use round-robin. `round_robin` policy ignores keys. Ordering is defined only within one partition.

Acknowledgement strength depends on `acks` and distribution settings. Async enqueue, buffered-writer flush, file sync, replica append, and committed HWM are distinct milestones.

## Consumer Group Read

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Consumer
    participant G as Group coordinator
    participant L as Partition leader

    C->>G: JOIN_GROUP / SYNC_GROUP
    G-->>C: member, generation, assignments
    C->>G: FETCH_OFFSET per assignment
    G-->>C: committed nextOffset
    C->>L: CONSUME or STREAM isolation=read_committed
    L-->>C: records bounded by HWM/LSO
    C->>C: process records
    C->>G: BATCH_COMMIT lastProcessedOffset+1
    G-->>C: OK or fencing/error
```

The broker committed offset is authoritative. A lower request offset does not replay records before an existing commit. A missing offset follows `autoOffsetReset`; an offset removed by retention returns `OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE`.

`read_committed` is the default: it returns ordinary records and committed transaction output, skips aborted/control records, and stops at the earliest unresolved transaction. `read_uncommitted` exposes the raw committed partition log.

## Transactional Consume-Process-Produce

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Transactional client
    participant X as Transaction coordinator
    participant P as Output partition leaders
    participant G as Group coordinator

    C->>X: INIT_PRODUCER_ID, BEGIN_TXN
    C->>X: TXN_PUBLISH
    X->>P: append unresolved idempotent record
    C->>X: SEND_OFFSETS_TO_TXN (one group session, multiple topics)
    C->>X: END_TXN result=commit
    X->>X: persist prepare_commit
    X->>G: atomic fenced multi-topic offset commit
    X->>P: append commit markers
    X->>X: persist committed decision
    X-->>C: OK state=committed
```

Output records remain invisible to `read_committed` until the partition marker and final coordinator decision agree. A restored prepared transaction is retried, while an open transaction past `transaction_timeout_ms` is durably aborted. Recovery work is indexed by coordinator shard and drained in bounded batches, so retained transaction history is not scanned on every monitor tick. Within this boundary, Cursus input offsets and output records form an exactly-once broker operation. Each completed epoch must be reinitialized before the next transaction; uncertain finalization retry keeps the old epoch.

## Event Sourcing

`APPEND_STREAM` hashes the aggregate key to a partition leader, checks `version = current + 1`, appends/replicates the event, advances committed state, and updates the stream index. `READ_STREAM` and `STREAM_VERSION` are leader-routed and bounded by committed HWM. Snapshots are quorum-replicated optimizations; committed event replay remains authoritative.

## Embedded Fan-out

`TopicManager.RegisterConsumerGroup` creates in-process partition/group/consumer channels using configured capacities. It provides low-latency fan-out inside the broker process, but it is not the dynamic network group coordinator and does not replace durable offset commits, generation fencing, or log replay.

## Failure Handling

- routing failures return `NOT_LEADER` or `NOT_COORDINATOR` with redirect data,
- stale group members/generations and producer epochs are fenced,
- malformed/unauthorized commands fail before mutation,
- partial active-segment tails are truncated during restart recovery,
- HWM is clamped to durable tail,
- stream socket loss without a close-control frame is retryable through the committed offset,
- retention gaps require explicit earliest/latest/error handling.
