# Consumer Groups

This document explains how consumer groups work in go-broker, including their structure, registration process, load balancing mechanism, and message distribution strategy. Consumer groups enable multiple consumers to share the load of processing messages from a topic while maintaining ordering guarantees within partitions.

For information about topic and partition structure, see [Topics and Partitions](./topics-and-partitions.md). For the broader topic management system, see [Topic Management System](./topic-management.md).

## Purpose and Functionality

Consumer groups provide a mechanism for horizontal scaling of message consumption. Multiple consumers can join a group to collectively process messages from a topic, with go-broker automatically distributing partitions among the consumers. 

Each partition's messages are delivered to exactly one consumer within a group, ensuring that ordering is preserved within each partition while enabling parallel processing across partitions.

## Key capabilities:

- **Load balancing**: Partitions are distributed evenly across consumers using modulo arithmetic
- **Ordering guarantees**: All messages from a single partition go to the same consumer
- **Independent consumption**: Multiple consumer groups can consume the same topic independently
- **Static assignment**: Partition-to-consumer mapping is established at registration time

## Data Structures

### ConsumerGroup Structure

The ConsumerGroup struct contains an array of Consumer instances. Each Consumer has a buffered channel (MsgCh) with capacity 1000 that receives messages from assigned partitions.

### Key Parameters:

| Component                | Buffer Size | Purpose                              |
|--------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Consumer.MsgCh           | 1000       | Consumer's message receive buffer     |
| Partition group channel  | 10000      | Per-group buffer in each partition    |
| Partition main channel   | 10000      | Partition's internal message buffer   |


## Registration Process

### RegisterConsumerGroup Method

The RegisterConsumerGroup method establishes a consumer group for a topic. It performs the following operations:

- **Check for existing group**: Returns existing group if already registered
- **Create consumer instances**: Allocates consumerCount consumers with buffered channels
- **Register with each partition**: Each partition creates a dedicated channel for the group
- **Establish partition-to-consumer mapping**: Uses modulo arithmetic for distribution
- **Start forwarding goroutines**: Bridge partition group channels to consumer channels

## Load Balancing Algorithm

### Partition-to-Consumer Distribution

Go-broker uses a deterministic modulo-based distribution algorithm:

```
target_consumer_index = partition_id % consumer_count
```

This ensures:

- **Even distribution**: Partitions are spread uniformly across consumers
- **Deterministic mapping**: Same partition always goes to same consumer
- **Ordering preservation**: All messages from a partition are processed in order

### Distribution Example:

```
Partition ID	Consumer Count	Target Consumer	Calculation
0	3	0	0 % 3 = 0
0 % 3 = 0
1	3	1	1 % 3 = 1
1 % 3 = 1
2	3	2	2 % 3 = 2
2 % 3 = 2
3	3	0	3 % 3 = 0
3 % 3 = 0
4	3	1	4 % 3 = 1
4 % 3 = 1
5	3	2	5 % 3 = 2
5 % 3 = 2
```

## Message Distribution

### From Partition to Consumer

Messages flow through multiple channels before reaching a consumer:


Message Path:

- **Partition channel** (Partition.ch): Receives published messages 
- **Partition run goroutine**: Fans out messages to all registered group channels 
- **Group channel** (subs[groupName]): Per-group buffer in each partition 
- **Forwarding goroutine**: Bridges group channel to specific consumer 
- **Consumer channel** (Consumer.MsgCh): Consumer's receive buffer 


## Partition Run Loop

The partition's `run()` method distributes messages to all registered consumer groups:

```
func (p *Partition) run() {
    for msg := range p.ch {
        p.mu.RLock()
        for _, subCh := range p.subs {  // Each group gets a copy
            subCh <- msg
        }
        p.mu.RUnlock()
    }
}
```

This design enables multiple independent consumer groups to consume the same topic without interference.

## Multi-Group Consumption

### Independent Consumer Groups

Multiple consumer groups can consume the same topic simultaneously. Each group maintains:

- Independent offset tracking (via direct channel consumption or disk reads)
- Separate partition-to-consumer mappings
- Isolated message delivery

## Concurrency and Thread Safety

### Locking Strategy

Consumer group registration and access use read-write mutexes:

| Operation                     | Lock Type   | Scope       |
|-------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| RegisterConsumerGroup          | Write lock | Topic.mu    |
| Consume channel lookup         | Read lock  | Topic.mu    |
| RegisterGroup                  | Write lock | Partition.mu|
| Partition message broadcast    | Read lock  | Partition.mu|


The locking hierarchy ensures:

- Consumer group map is protected during registration
- Partition subscription map is protected during group registration
- Message broadcasting holds minimal locks (read locks only)

## Key Characteristics

### Behavior Summary

| Aspect                  | Behavior                                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Partition assignment     | Static, established at registration             |
| Distribution algorithm   | Modulo: partition_id % consumer_count           |
| Ordering guarantee       | Per-partition ordering maintained               |
| Group isolation          | Groups consume independently                     |
| Rebalancing              | Not supported (static assignment)               |
| Consumer failure         | Channel blocks, may lead to backpressure        |
| Buffer overflow          | Goroutine blocks if consumer channel full       |

### Limitations

- **Static assignment**: Consumers cannot be added/removed without re-registration
- **No automatic rebalancing**: Partition distribution doesn't adjust to consumer changes
- **No offset management**: Applications must track their own offsets for disk reads
- **Channel-based only**: Active consumption through channels, no pull-based API in this layer

# Summary

Consumer groups in go-broker provide load balancing and ordering guarantees through a deterministic partition assignment mechanism. The modulo-based distribution ensures even load across consumers while maintaining per-partition message ordering. 

Multiple consumer groups can independently consume the same topic, each with its own partition-to-consumer mapping and isolated message delivery channels.

The implementation uses goroutines to bridge partition group channels to consumer message channels, with buffering at multiple levels (partition: 10000, group channel: 10000, consumer: 1000) to handle bursts and provide backpressure protection.
