# Getting Started

This page provides a quick start guide to get cursus running on your system. 

It covers the basic prerequisites, installation methods, and initial verification steps to ensure the broker is operational. For detailed configuration options, see [Configuration](../user-guide/configuration.md).

## Prerequisites

Before running cursus, ensure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Go  | 1.21+ | Required for building from source |
| Docker  | 20.10+ | Required for containerized deployment |
| Make  | 3.81+ | For using Makefile commands (Optional) |

# Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get cursus running is using Docker Compose:

## Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/downfa11-org/cursus
cd cursus
```

## Start the broker

This starts a container with:

```
docker-compose -f manifests/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

- Main broker on port 9000 (TCP)
- Health check endpoint on port 9080 (HTTP)
- Prometheus metrics on port 9100 (HTTP)

The container uses the configuration at 
`manifests/config.yaml` and mounts a volume for persistent storage at `./logs`.


# Quick Start from Source

To build and run cursus from source:

## Build all binaries

```
make build
```

## Run the broker

```
./bin/cursus

// Or run in development mode:
// make run
```
The make build target invokes three sub-targets:

- `build-api` → builds `./bin/cursus` 
- `build-cli` → builds `./bin/cursus-cli`
- `build-bench` → builds `./bin/cursus-bench` 

All builds use `CGO_ENABLED=0` and target Linux with static linking via `-ldflags="-s -w`".


# Verifying the Installation

After starting cursus, verify it's running correctly:

1. **Health Check**

   ```
   curl http://localhost:9080/health
   ```
   Expected response: OK with HTTP 200 status.

2. **Metrics Endpoint**

    ```
    curl http://localhost:9100/metrics
    ```
    Expected response: Prometheus-formatted metrics including:
    - `broker_messages_published_total`
    - `broker_messages_consumed_total`
    - `broker_active_consumers`

3. **TCP Connection Test**

    Connect to the broker using `netcat`:

    ```
    nc localhost 9000
    ```

    Then send a command like `LIST` to verify command processing.


# Running Modes

cursus can run in two modes:

## Broker Mode (Server)

This is the standard mode that starts the TCP server:

```
./bin/cursus

// Or using make:
// make run
```

The broker process:

1. Loads configuration 
2. Initializes DiskManager for persistence
3. Initializes TopicManager for routing
4. Starts TCP listener on port specified in `cfg.BrokerPort`
5. Starts health check HTTP server on port 9080
6. If enabled, starts Prometheus exporter on `cfg.ExporterPort`


## CLI Mode (Interactive)

This mode provides an interactive command-line interface:

```
./bin/cursus-cli

// Or using make:
// make cli
```

The CLI process:

1. Loads the same configuration
2. Initializes DiskManager and TopicManager
3. Creates a CommandHandler for processing commands
4. Enters interactive mode accepting `stdin` commands

Supports commands: `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `LIST`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `PUBLISH`, `CONSUME`, `EXIT` 

# Common Makefile Commands

The repository includes a comprehensive Makefile for development tasks:

## Command	Purpose
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build all binaries (broker, CLI, benchmark) |
| `make run` | Run broker in development mode |
| `make cli` | Run CLI in development mode |
| `make test` | Run unit tests with race detection |
| `make bench` | Run performance benchmarks |
| `make lint` | Run `golangci-lint` |
| `make docker` | Build Docker image |
| `make compose-up` | Start docker-compose stack |
| `make compose-down` | Stop docker-compose stack |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts and test data |
| `make coverage` | Generate test coverage report |


# Next Steps

Now that you have cursus running, you can:

- Configure the broker - Learn about [configuration options in Configuration](./configuration.md)
- Create topics and publish messages - See [Running the Broker for basic operations](../core/server.md)
- Understand the architecture - Review [Architecture Overview for system design](../architecture.md)
- Monitor the broker - Learn about [metrics in Monitoring and Observability](../reference/observability.md)
- Tune performance - See [Performance Tuning for optimization parameters](../reference/performance.md)

For production deployments, refer to Deployment for [best practices](../reference/performance.md) and [operational considerations](../reference/observability.md)
